## Troubleshooting

**There are always people trying to manually generate the `xorg.conf` file, which is very wrong! There is a good chance that you can't open the desktop not because of a configuration problem with this file! You should check the graphics driver or the desktop itself. xorg is almost never a problem!Xorg hardly ever goes wrong!**
