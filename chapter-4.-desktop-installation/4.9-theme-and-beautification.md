# 4.9 Themes and Beautification

After installing the desktop environment on **FreeBSD**, as with other **class Unix** systems, a simple and plain color palette is often what comes to mind. This unadorned setting may be overwhelming to new users for a while. The logic behind it is actually quite simple: firstly, it is for the stability of the system, and secondly, the beautification of the desktop system, which involves personal aesthetics, is difficult to be adjusted by the public. For the sake of system aesthetics, we learn to add **Theme** and **Icons** in this section.

## Installing packages

- [ ] Beginner's task: Choose one theme and one icon from each of the following packages to install.

**Note: This section only covers the `GTK` library of desktop themes, including the `Gnome`, `XFCE`, `MATE`, `Cinnamon` and `LXDE` desktop environments.**
