# 4.11 Installing Wayland (optional)

> Not available at this time.
Wayland is a replacement for Xorg. The difference in use is that the former interface renders better and more smoothly than xorg; the touchpad effect is closer to macOS.

Wayland is officially supported in FreeBSD, version 1.20. Note: Please use the latest source to install the package, as it is the latest commit. No desktops are currently supported after testing.
