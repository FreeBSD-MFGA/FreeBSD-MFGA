# 4.2 Installing KDE 5

> The following tutorial applies to users whose shell is csh/tcsh.
>
>First see if your shell is csh/tcsh now

>`# echo $0`

> If it's either csh/tcsh, continue.

## Install

```
# pkg install xorg sddm kde5 wqy-fonts xdg-user-dirs
```


> The above command installs the desktop, window manager and fonts and the tools to create user directories, respectively.

## Configuration

`# ee /etc/fstab`

Add the following:

```
proc /proc procfs rw 0 0
```

>Add proc mount this step is very necessary, if not add will cause the desktop service can not run properly, some components can not be loaded!

Then


```
sysrc dbus_enable="YES"
sysrc sddm_enable="YES"
```

and then

```
# echo "exec ck-launch-session startplasma-x11" > ~/.xinitrc
```

> If you have already run it under root, a new user will still have to run it again to get it to work (no root privileges or sudo, etc.) `startx`.

Hint: hal has been removed. **No need** to add ~~hald_enable="YES",~~ visit:

**Note: If sddm login flashes to the login screen, please check if plasma-X11 is in the bottom left corner, the one that flashes is usually Wayland!**
