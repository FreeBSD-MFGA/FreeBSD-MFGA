## Network Setup

Please use NAT mode, if you can't interoperate with the host (physical machine), please open VMware Edit - Virtual Network Manager and remove the first item "Bridging". After removing it, restart the virtual machine and it should work.

If there is no network, please set the DNS to `223.5.5.5`. Please see section 4 of this chapter.

## Graphics drivers and virtual machine enhancement tools

### Graphics drivers

For VMware to automatically scale the screen please install the graphics card driver and the virtual machine enhancement tool, i.e.

```
## pkg install xf86-video-vmware open-vm-tools
```

After installation, you don't need any extra configuration to achieve automatic screen scaling.

>Do not make redundant configurations, such as creating `xorg.conf`, as this can cause problems such as virtual machine crashes.

>You also need to install this driver under wayland. Even though wayland is temporarily unavailable.

> If the screen is not displayed properly (too big), please try: Edit the virtual machine settings --> Hardware, Devices --> Monitor --> Monitor, Specify monitor settings --> Maximum resolution for any monitor, set to the host's resolution or slightly lower than the host's resolution.


### Virtual Machine Enhancement Tools

If there is a desktop

```
# pkg install open-vm-tools
```

If there is no desktop.

```
# pkg install open-vm-tools-nox11
```

Specific configuration

Edit `/boot/loader.conf`

Write in

```
fusefs_load="YES"
```

### Shared folder

Please install the virtual machine enhancement tool first.

```
# mount -t .host:/ /mnt/hgfs
```

View the shared folder

```
# ls /mnt/hgfs
```

**Note: Due to a bug, FreeBSD 11/12 may not boot in VmMare's UEFI environment. Tested 13.0 boots normally.**

>**Tips**
>
> When using Windows Remote Desktop or other XRDP tools to remote another Windows desktop and operate FreeBSD with a VMware virtual machine running on top of it, the mouse often becomes difficult to control.
