## Configure SSH

### Allow root ssh

```     
# ee /etc/ssh/sshd_config # (delete the previous # and change yes or no to the following)
PermitRootLogin yes # Allow root login 
PasswordAuthentication yes # (optional) set whether to use normal password authentication, if not set this parameter to use PAM authentication login, more secure
```

> Hint: What does it mean to delete the previous `#`? `#` is generally used as a comment in UNIX, equivalent to `//` in C language. It means that the text after it is only descriptive and has no practical effect.

### Turn on SSH service

```
# service sshd restart
```

If `sshd` is not found, please execute the next command:

```
# sysrc sshd_enable="YES"
```

and then

```
# service sshd restart
```

### Keep SSH online

Server-side settings.

Edit ``# ee /etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and adjust the ``ClientAlive` settings.

```
ClientAliveInterval 10
ClientAliveCountMax 3
```

If the client does not respond 3 times, the client is considered disconnected.

``ClientAliveInterval`` defaults to ``0``, which means that detection is disabled.

Client settings.

`# ee /etc/ssh/ssh_config` for global users, `~/.ssh/config` for current users only.

```
Host *
ServerAliveInterval 10
ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

Or, when connecting, use `-o` to specify the following parameters.

```
# ssh user@server -p 22 -o ServerAliveInterval=10 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3
```

Just turn on detection on either the client or server side.


## SSH key login

### Generate the key

```
## ssh-keygen
```

>OpenSSH 7.0 and above disables the ssh-dss (DSA) public key algorithm by default. FreeBSD 13.0 uses OpenSSH_7.9. so just use the default.

```
root@ykla:~ # ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): # Enter here
Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): #Enter password here (password is recommended for security)
Enter same passphrase again: #Repeat password here
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:MccEjGhWCv6P/8y62JfbpEws9OnRN1W0adxmpceNny8 root@ykla
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|.  o.o...      ... |o.o....
|... +... ...      o+*|
+...     .     o*B|
| .    .      o=. |o=.
| . . o S . ... |.
+ o+o .   . |.
| . o *.o o E . |.
+ Bo= . .  . |.
| . ==O..       | .
+----[SHA256]-----+
root@ykla:~ # 
```

### Configure the key

Check the permissions (the default created permissions are as follows)

```
drwx------ 2 root wheel 512 Mar 22 18:27 /root/.ssh # Permissions are 700
-rw------- 1 root wheel 1856 Mar 22 18:27 /root/.ssh/id_rsa #private key with permissions of 600
-rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 391 Mar 22 18:27 /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub #public key with permissions 644
```

Generate the authentication public key.

```
# cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 391 Mar 22 18:39 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys # check permissions 644
```

After saving the private and public keys locally using winscp, delete the extra files on the server:.

```
# rm /root/.ssh/id_rsa*
```

### Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config

```
# ee /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Modify the configuration as follows (remove the leading # and change yes or no to the following)

```
PermitRootLogin yes # Allow ROOT users to log in directly to the system
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys #Modify to use the key file in the user directory, the default has been configured correctly, please check
PasswordAuthentication no #Do not allow users to log in with password
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no #Disable password authentication
PermitEmptyPasswords no #Disable login for users with empty passwords
```

### Restart the service

```
# service sshd restart
```

Use xshell to login, enter the key password, import the private key `id_rsa`, and you can login.

>If you can't login with other ssh software, please convert the key format by yourself.
