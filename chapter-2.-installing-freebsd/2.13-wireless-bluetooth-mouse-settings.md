# 2.13 Wireless Bluetooth Mouse Setup

> This article is based on FreeBSD 13.0 and uses the Logitech m337.

```
# sysrc hcsecd_enable="YES".
# sysrc bthidd_enable="YES"
# service hcsecd start
# service bthidd start
```

Just use `bluetooth-config` tool to add Bluetooth devices.

Turn the Bluetooth mouse to pairing mode, run `# bluetooth-config scan` and follow the prompts to add the device.

```
# bluetooth-config scan
Scan for new bluetooth devices (1 out of 5 attempts)... Done.
Found 1 new Bluetooth device (now scanning for name).
[1] 34:88:5d:12:34:56 "Bluetooth Mouse M336/M337/M535" (Logitech-M337)
Select the device to be paired [1, or 0 to rescan].1

This device provides HMI device service.
Set it? [Yes].
```

> Note: Logitech M337 will automatically disconnect after pairing connection. Solution: Delete the `bd_addr` line `xx:xx:xx:xx` in the `/var/db/bthidd.hids` file corresponding to the mouse and restart the bthidd service `# service bthidd restart`.
