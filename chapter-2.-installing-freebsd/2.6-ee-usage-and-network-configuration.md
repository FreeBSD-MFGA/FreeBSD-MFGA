# 2.6 ee Usage and Network Configuration

## Overview

### ee usage

ee is much simpler to use than nano. It is a text editor that comes with thebase system.

For example

```
# ee a.txt
```

Press ESC, a prompt box will be displayed, press enter twice to save.

### Network configuration

First `ifconfig` to see if there is a network card, if not then it is out of the scope of this section. Please note that `lo0` is not the real NIC, if you can only see this it means your NIC is not properly driven.

Example output.

```
root@ykla:~ # ifconfig
genet0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> metric 0 mtu 1500
	options=68000b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6>
	ether dc:a6:1a:2e:f4:4t
	inet 192.168.123.157 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.123.255
	media: Ethernet autoselect (1000baseT <full-duplex>)
	status: active
	nd6 options=29<PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>
lo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> metric 0 mtu 16384
	options=680003<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6>
	inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128
	inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x2
	inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
	groups: lo
	nd6 options=21<PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>
root@ykla:~ # 
```

The following applies to both virtual and physical machines.

By default, FreeBSD is properly networked, if not it may be because DNS is not properly configured.

```
# ee /etc/resolv.conf
```

Clear out the contents. Add the following.

```
nameserver 8.8.8.8  #Google DNS
nameserver 8.8.4.4
````
After that restart the network configuration

```
# /etc/netstart restart
```

Try pinging google.com. (Press ctrl + C to interrupt)

Example output.

```
root@ykla:~ # ping google.com
