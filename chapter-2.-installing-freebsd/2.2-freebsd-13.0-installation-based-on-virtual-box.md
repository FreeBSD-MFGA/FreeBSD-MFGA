# 2.2 FreeBSD 13.0 Installation - Based on Virtual Box

**Note: This virtual machine is not recommended for novices, as there are more potholes to step through.**

## Download VirtualBox

Click `download` to download.

<https://www.virtualbox.org>

## Installation Setup

After the installation is finished, please shut down the computer manually, uninstall or delete the installation CD, otherwise it will enter the installation screen again.

## Network Settings

The network setup is complicated. In order to control the FreeBSD system in the virtual machine using the host (e.g. Windows 10), you need to set up two network cards - one in NAT mode for Internet access and the other in host-only mode for interoperability with the host. As shown in the figure.

Use the command `# ifconfig` to see if the second NIC `em1` is not getting an ip address, please DHCP it manually: `# dhclient em1` to get it (for long term effect add `ifconfig_em1="DHCP"` to `/etc/rc.conf`).

If you don't have a network (internet) set DNS to `223.5.5.5`. If not, visit section 4 of this chapter.

## Install enhancement tools

```
## pkg install virtualbox-ose-additions
```

xorg can automatically recognize the driver, no need to manually configure `/usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf` (after testing the manual configuration but more card, click it takes 5 seconds to move once ......).

Use `VBoxSVGA` for the graphics card controller.

Edit `# ee etc/rc.conf` and add the following.

```
vboxguest_enable="YES"
vboxservice_enable="YES"
```

Start the service and adjust the permissions to.

```
# service vboxguest restart # May indicate that the module is not found, but it does not affect the use
# service vboxservice restart
# pw groupmod wheel -m <yourname> # sudo permissions
# pw groupmod opt -m <yourname> # boot reboot permissions
```

## Troubleshooting
 
If you can't get the mouse in or out, press `ctrl` on the right (there is a `ctrl` on the left and right side of the keyboard, which is the default setting); if you need to restore the auto-scaling screen or can't find the menu bar, press `home` + `ctrl` on the right (hint: the `home` key is under the `Scroll Lock` on the 108 keyboard.
