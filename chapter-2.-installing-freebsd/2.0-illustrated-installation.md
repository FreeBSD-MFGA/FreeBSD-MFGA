Modern computers should choose GPT+UEFI. older computers (e.g. before 2013) should choose the option to keep it consistent with the picture (GPT(BIOS)).

Recommended choice: Here is the security enhancement choice, you should choose `disable_sendmail`, if you do not disable this service will make you stuck for a few minutes every time you boot up, and this service itself is not useful, it is for sending emails.
