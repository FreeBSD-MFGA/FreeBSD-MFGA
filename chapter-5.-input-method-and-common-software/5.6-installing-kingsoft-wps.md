# 5.6 Installing Kingsoft WPS


Kingsoft WPS provides two versions, one is the international version and the other is the Chinese version. **The international version has no Chinese Language support.**

For both, you need to install the Linux compatibility layer first, see the rest of the book for font issues.


## International version

linux-wps-office

Please note: The server of the international version is outside the country, the download speed is very slow in the country, please refer to chapter 7 section 1

Installation, currently you can only install it via ports

```
# cd /usr/ports/editors/linux-wps-office/ && make install clean # add BATCH=yes if you want to default
```

## Chinese version

linux-wps-office-zh_CN

Installation, currently only available through ports.

```
# cd /usr/ports/chinese/linux-wps-office-zh_CN/ && make install clean # add BATCH=yes if you want the default
```

## Troubleshooting

 - WPS may not run under KDE5.

Because the WPS startup file calls the bash shell, it will run normally after installing bash.

```
# pkg install bash
```

- fcitx 5 does not work with WPS

This is a known bug in WPS: `# pkg install bash`
