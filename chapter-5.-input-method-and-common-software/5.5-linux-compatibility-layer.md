# 5.5 Linux Compatibility Layer

**Note: A common misconception is to treat the Linux compatibility layer of FreeBSD as Wine, believing that this will slow down the software. The reality is that not only will it not be slower, but some software will run faster and more efficiently than it would in Linux.**

## System self-contained.

The following references

[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/)

### Turn on services

```
## sysrc linux_enable="YES"
# sysrc kld_list+="linux linux64"
# kldload linux64
# pkg install emulators/linux-c7 dbus
# service linux start
# sysrc dbus_enable="YES"
# service dbus start
# dbus-uuidgen > /compat/linux/etc/machine-id
# reboot
```
### Configure fstab

Write the following to `/etc/fstab`:

```
linprocfs /compat/linux/proc linprocfs rw 0 0
linsysfs /compat/linux/sys linsysfs rw 0 0
tmpfs /compat/linux/dev/shm tmpfs rw,mode=1777 0 0
```

Check the mount for reported errors.

```
# mount -al
```

```
# reboot
```
## Build your own Ubuntu compatibility layer

>**The following tutorials have only been tested with FreeBSD 13.0. The build is for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (18.04 is also possible). The compatibility layer uses a technology that is actually Linux jail, not chroot.**

**You need to configure the native CentOS compatibility layer as per the pkg/ports method first.** 

**For more information on other systems, see `/usr/local/share/debootstrap/scripts`.**

**See `/usr/local/share/debootstrap/scripts/`** for more information on other systems

Write `nullfs_load="YES"` to `/boot/loader.conf`

### Start the build

```
# pkg install debootstrap
# debootstrap focal /compat/ubuntu http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/
# reboot
```
### Mount the filesystem
Write the following line to `/etc/fstab`.
```
# Device Mountpoint FStype Options Dump Pass#
devfs /compat/ubuntu/dev devfs rw,late 0 0
tmpfs /compat/ubuntu/dev/shm tmpfs rw,late,size=1g,mode=1777 0 0
fdescfs /compat/ubuntu/dev/fd fdescfs rw,late,linrdlnk 0 0
linprocfs /compat/ubuntu/proc linprocfs rw,late 0 0
linsysfs /compat/ubuntu/sys linsysfs rw,late 0 0
/tmp /compat/ubuntu/tmp nullfs rw,late 0 0
/home /compat/ubuntu/home nullfs rw,late 0 0
```
Check the mount for errors.

```
# mount -al
```

If there is no home folder, please create a new one:
```
# mkdir /home
```
### Jail

First chroot into Ubuntu and remove the software that will report an error: `# mkdir /home`
```
# chroot /compat/ubuntu /bin/bash 
# apt remove rsyslog # At this point you are already in the Ubuntu compatibility layer.
```

### Change source



```
# ee /compat/ubuntu/etc/apt/sources.list # This is a FreeBSD system! Because the Ubuntu compatibility layer does not have a text editor yet.
```
Writes to.
```
deb http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse

deb http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
```
Go to the Ubuntu compatibility layer and start updating your system and installing common software:

```
# LANG=C # Set the character set to prevent errors, i18n users needs.
# apt update && apt upgrade && apt install nano wget # At this point you are already in the Ubuntu compatibility layer.
```

### Run the X11 software

```
# xhost +local: # At this point in FreeBSD!
```

#### Don't know what the command line startup command of the program is?

Please find them in the following order (using `gedit` as an example).

 - Execute the package name directly `# gedit`.
 - `whereis package name`, locate it and execute it. `whereis gedit`.
 - Locate the software by its icon, find the path `/usr/share/applications`, find the software by its package name, and open it with a text editor (e.g. `ee`, `nano`). (The software icon is essentially a text file, not a soft link or image.) Find the command to run the program and copy it to the terminal to run it.
 - Find it globally with the `find` command `# find / -name package name`, `# find / -name gedit`.

### Example: running Chrome

```
# wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb # No proxy software needed, you can connect directly. At this point it is already in the Ubuntu compatibility layer.
# apt install . /google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb # This is already in the Ubuntu compatibility tier.
```

```
# /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --no-sandbox --no-zygote --in-process-gpu # This is already in the Ubuntu compatibility tier.
```

>A similar approach can be used to build Debian and Arch-compatible layers (tested to indicate that the kernel is too old, and older versions force upgrades that do not work). gentoo-compatible layers indicate a bash so file error, even if zsh is statically compiled.

>I have imported <https://github.com/zq1997/deepin-wine> sources to install deepin-qq, deepin-wechat, etc., but they all show segment errors. All Wine programs do not run properly. If you can solve this problem, please raise an issue or pull.
