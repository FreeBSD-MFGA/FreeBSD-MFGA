# 24.2 FreeBSD Directory Structure

FreeBSD is collegial and well-organized by design.

| Paths | Introduction |
| :------------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
| `/bin` | The basic tools directory in single-user and multi-user environments.              | |sbin
| `/sbin` | The basic utility directory for storing system programs and administrative needs in single-user and multi-user environments.        | `/sbin
| `/etc` | The system configuration and scripts.                   | `/etc
| `/usr/bin` | The directory where system applications are stored.                   | `/usr/bin`
| `/usr/sbin` | Holds system background programs and system tools (executed by the user).           | `/usr/lib
| `/usr/libexec` | Holds system utilities or background programs (executed from a separate program).           |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files. The contents of the /tmp directory are not normally retained after a system reboot.      |
| `/var/log` | The various system logs.                   |
| `/var/tmp` | Temporary files. These files are usually retained upon system reboot, unless /var is an in-memory file system. |var
| `/var/run` | Used to store Pidfiles. |

It is worth noting that FreeBSD does not use `/proc` or procfs now.

For user-installed programs, the allowed directories to write to are.

* `/var/run`
* `/var/log`
* `/var/tmp`
* `/tmp`

User-installed programs are unified under `/usr/local`, for example.

* `/usr/local/bin`
* `/usr/local/sbin`
* `/usr/local/etc`
* `/usr/local/libexec`

In short: the system uses `/usr` and the user uses `/usr/local`. This is very different from Linux, which is theoretically designed to do the same thing, but in practice it is very difficult to do.
