# 24.4 Disabling Sendmail

Sendmail is always started by default on FreeBSD systems, which is useless for most people and causes a delay of several minutes at startup; its service can be disabled during installation, as described in the installation instructions.


Edit `/etc/rc.conf` and add the following lines.

```
sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
```

Edit `/etc/periodic.conf` and add the following lines to disable certain settings that are only used by Sendmail.

```
daily_clean_hoststat_enable="NO"
daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"
daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
daily_submit_queuerun="NO"
```
