# 6.5 SWAP settings

If you do not set up a swap partition when you install the system, you can only do it later by dding a swap partition file. Because neither UFS nor ZFS supports shrinking file system partitions ......

dd a swap file of 1GB in size.

```
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/swap0 bs=1M count=1024
```

Set the permissions to 600, i.e. only the owner has read and write access.

```
# chmod 0600 /usr/swap0
```

For immediate use.

```
# mdconfig -a -t vnode -f /usr/swap0 -u 0 && swapon /dev/md0
```

In order to work after reboot, you also need to add to `/etc/rc.conf`

```
swapfile="/usr/swap0"
```
