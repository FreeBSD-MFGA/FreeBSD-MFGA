# 6.6 Ext 2/3/4 etc. file systems

## EXT file system

Please note: `fusefs-ext2` (which also supports EXT2/3/4) should be installed here instead of `fusefs-ext4fuse` because the latter is read-only and deprecated.

- Installing fusefs-ext2

```
# pkg install fusefs-ext2
```

- Loading

    Open `/etc/rc.conf` and add **ext2fs** to the `kld_list` section, the result may look like `kld_list="ext2fs i915kms"`
    
- After reboot, mount.

    For an account with the username `XiaoMing`, this could be done as follows.

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir media
$ cd media
$ mkdir first
# mount -t ext2fs /dev/da0sX /home/XiaoMing/media/first/
```

*Note: The above equation is not necessarily `da0sX` (X is the corresponding number), you can check the drive name with the `# gpart list` command.*
    
- To unmount a hard drive

`# umount /home/XiaoMing/media/first/`

## Brtfs/XFS file system

> untested

```
# pkg install fusefs-lkl
```
