## Section 9 Csh and Other Shells

## FreeBSD csh shell configuration

>**Note**
>
>This section may no longer be relevant, as the shell in FreeBSD 14 has been standardized to sh.

In `/etc/csh.cshrc` add:

`alias ls ls -G`

and log back in.

Q: How do I get FreeBSD csh to list uncompleted candidates by Tab, like bash does?

A: The standard method is to press `Ctrl+D`.

But if you must use `Tab`, add to `/etc/csh.cshrc`: `set autolist`

## How can FreeBSD make csh have command error correction like zsh?

For example, if you write c programs in emacs, but you type `emacs ma` and press `Tab` to enter, he will match all the files starting with `ma`, and this is ignored, that is, when you press `Tab` there will be nothing you ignore, friendly for programming and such, no more matching to binary. Files like `.o` and so on.

```
　set correct = cmd lz/usr/bin tcsh>ls /usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?
　set fignore = (.o ~) emacs ma[^D] main.c main.c~ main.o emacs ma[tab] emacs main.c
```

## Changing the default shell

Warning: Switching the default `Shell` will cause **recovery mode to not start loading the command line environment properly**.

For example, switching to zsh.

```
# pkg install zsh zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting
# chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
# touch ~/.zshrc
```
```
# ee ~/.zshrc 
```

Add the following lines:

```
source /usr/local/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
source /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
source ~/.p10k.zsh
```

Switching to bash:

```
# pkg install bash
# chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
# ee ~/.bash_profile
```
