# 26.0 Overview

OpenBSD, also a Unix-like computer operating system, was born in 1995 as a spin-off from NetBSD by Dutch-Canadian programmer Theo de Raadt. openBSD claims to be the world's most secure operating system. The LLVM/Clang project is used to build the system, the default shell is ksh, and the mascot is a pufferfish named Puffy.

Compared to other BSD systems, OpenBSD's claims tend to be more security oriented. User experience with this may be a matter of opinion (the whole system does not run efficiently), after all, one of the consequences of this is that there are relatively few softwares, not only far behind FreeBSD, but even slightly behind NetBSD. The good news, however, is that OpenBSD maintains many architectures such as amd64/i386, arm64/armv7 and riscv64 with a small amount of manpower and resources, making it a truly general purpose operating system. In order to expand the desktop user base, desktop environments such as Gnome, KDE (currently version 3.5) and XFCE are packaged, as well as a large number of software packages such as Blender, Firefox, Krita and libreoffice. It is believed that in the future, OpenBSD will gradually optimize its performance to better serve all of humanity.

OpenBSD is well known on the Chinese Internet because of the news that in 2014 the project was at risk of being shut down due to unpaid electricity bills. A number of companies came to its aid, including Luo Yonghao's Hammer Technology in China.
