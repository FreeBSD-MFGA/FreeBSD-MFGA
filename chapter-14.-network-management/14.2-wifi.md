# 14.2 WiFi

**Intel WIFI 5/6 chips (AC 8265, AC 9260, AC 9560, AX200, AX201, AX210) drivers are available in the last section.**

**Note: If the wireless card is not recognized when you install FreeBSD, then your wireless card is not supported. Please ignore the following.**

## General NIC drivers

First run `# ifconfig` and see if you can find your NIC, if you can, then you can skip this section.

Run `# sysctl net.wlan.devices`, he will tell you the wireless NIC driver, if there is nothing after the colon output, then it is not recognized. Please replace the wireless card.

Edit the /boot/loader.conf file

Add.

```
if_urtwn_load="YES" 
legal.realtek.license_ack=1
```

>**Note**, the
>
>This is just an example, please add your own required drivers (see the output of `# sysctl net.wlan.devices`).

Next, create wlan0

```
# ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev at0
```

`at0` is your NIC, see your own `# sysctl net.wlan.devices` output, this command is temporary, if you need to boot permanently to take effect, in `rc.conf`, add.

```
# wlans_ath0 = "wlan0"
```

Scan for WiFi.

```
# ifconfig wlan0 up scan
# ifconfig wlan0 ssid abc
```

Connect to WiFi: ``` # ifconfig wlan0 up scan

```
# dhclient wlan0
```

Get IP address

Connect to an encrypted network

Create `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

```
network={ 
ssid="WIFI name (SSID)" 
psk="WIFI password"
}
```

In `rc.conf`, add

```
# ifconfig_wlan0="WPA SYNCDHCP"
```

Then reboot the computer (because there is something wrong with the command, you can only reboot to make rc.conf take effect)

```
# wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan // search for nearby wifi networks
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan_result // Print the results of the wifi network search
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 add_network // Add a network connection
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 remove_network 1 // Remove a network connection
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 set_network 0 ssid '"name"'
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 set_network 0 psk '"psk"'
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 enable_network 0
```

Save the connection

```
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 save_config
```

Disconnect

```
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 disable_network 0
```

Connect an existing connection

```
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 list_network Enumerate all saved connections
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 select_network 0 Connects the 1st saved connection
# wpa_cli -i wlan0 enable_network 0 Enables the 1st saved connection
```

Disconnect WiFi

```
# ifconfig wlan0 down
```

wpa authentication, static ip

```
# ifconfig_wlan0="WPA inet 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0"

# ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

Turn on wireless ap, make sure your NIC supports hostap first

```
# ifconfig wlan0 list caps
```

Destroy first

```
# ifconfig wlan0 destroy
```

then create

```
# ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode hostap

# ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 ssid freebsdap mode 11g channel 1
```

>If you can't connect or can't find the debug channel, try to select `Japan` for the WiFi area code, and then select `China`.

### Simple version

Take the crab card as an example.

## Intel WIFI 5/6 chips

**The following section does not apply to FreeBSD 13.1. 13.1 already has the driver loaded properly.**

>The following sections apply only to FreeBSD 13.1, 14.0.
>
>The iwlwifi driver is available for the `AC 8265, AC 9260, AC 9560, AX200, AX201, AX210` and older NICs included in the iwm driver, see <https://www.intel.cn/content/www/cn/zh/support/articles/000005511/wireless.html>. For iwm(4) legacy NICs that want to use this driver, please refer to <https://wiki.freebsd.org/WiFi/Iwlwifi#I_have_an_iwm.284.29_supported_device>.
> 
>**This driver is still not perfect, it is not loaded automatically under FreeBSD 14 (you can use the command `# sysctl net.wlan.devices` to see if it is loaded, if it does not show `iwlwifi0` it is not loaded), you need to load it manually every time.**

Write the following section to `/etc/rc.conf`.

```
kld_list="if_iwlwifi"
wlans_iwlwifi0="wlan0"
wlandebug_wlan0="+state +crypto +node +auth +assoc +dot1xsm +wpa"
ifconfig_wlan0="WPA SYNCDHCP"
```

Create `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

```
network={ 
ssid="WIFI name (SSID)" 
psk="WIFI password"
}
```

Load the driver first to see.

```
# kldload if_iwlwifi
```

>**Note: The following part must be executed once per boot in order to network.**


Create and link.

```
# ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev iwlwifi0
# /etc/rc.d/netif start wlan0
```
