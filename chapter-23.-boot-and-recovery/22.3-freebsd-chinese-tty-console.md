# 22.3 FreeBSD Chinese TTY Console


FreeBSD's new terminal, VT, supports `cjk`, so put a font in it and it will display Chinese.

1. First you have not changed the console program, the default is used.

2. This note is based on FreeBSD 12.1 release as an example.

The font format is `.fnt`.	

Command: `$ vidcontrol -f ABC.fnt`

The FreeBSD base system provides a tool for converting bdf, hex to fnt

```
vtfontcvt [ -h height ] [ -v ] [ -w width ] [ font ]
```

The commands are temporary, to make them permanent, add them to ``rc.conf``
