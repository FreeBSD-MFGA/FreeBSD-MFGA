# 23.5 Grub and other guides

According to the FreeBSD developers, because the ZFS module of `grub` is not provided by BSD, but developed by themselves, `grub` cannot boot directly into the FreeBSD kernel and boot the system. It can only boot indirectly by using `chainlain+1`.

```
menuentry "FreeBSD-13.0 Release" {
set root='(hd0,gpt1)' # Please check yourself
chainloader /boot/boot1.efi
}
```
