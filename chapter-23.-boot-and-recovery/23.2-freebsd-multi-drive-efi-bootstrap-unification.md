# 23.2 FreeBSD Multi-Drive EFI Bootstrap Unification

What does multi-drive EFI unification mean? It means that there are two hard disks with EFI partitions on each of them, one with FreeBSD in it and the other with Windows.

Now I want to keep only one partition, i.e. I want to put the EFI configuration files into the EFI partition of one hard disk and unify it.

Let the drive with Windows be `ada0` and the FreeBSD drive be `nvd0`.

First, turn off the Windows fastboot: the command is `powercfg /h off`.

Then shutdown and reboot into FreeBSD and create a mount point `mkdir /mnt/efi`. Check if `ada0p1` (the first partition of the drive) is the EFI partition we want to mount by entering the command `fstyp /dev/ada0p1`, my output is NTFS, so it is not the EFI partition we want.

`fstyp /dev/ada0p2`, the output is `msdosfs`, which is the EFI partition on our Windows disk.

Next mount the EFI partition on disk ada0 to `/mnt/efi` in FreeBSD: `# mount -t msdosfs /dev/ada0p2 /mnt/efi`

Create a directory under the EFI path for FreeBSD bootability: `# mkdir /mnt/efi/EFI/freeb`sd

Then copy the boot file to that path `# cp /boot/boot1.efi /mnt/efi/EFI/freebsd/bootx64.efi`

Finally generate the boot entry: `# efibootmgr -c -l /mnt/efi/EFI/freebsd/bootx64.efi -L "FreeBSD niu pi"`

Just reboot into Windows and use easyuefi to activate the `FreeBSD niu pi` boot entry. If there is no problem, you can use DiskGenius to delete the EFI partition file from the nvd0 disk.
