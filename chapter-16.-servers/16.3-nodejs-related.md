# 16.3 Nodejs related

## Installation on FreeBSD 13

`nodejs` relies on a particular version of `/lib/libcrypto.so.111`, and this means that if you need to use NodeJS on FreeBSD, you must keep an eye on the version of FreeBSD itself, especially if your pkg configuration uses the latest source.

In general, if you want to install node+yarn on FreeBSD 13.1, do this.

```
# freebsd-update fetch install # must update the base system first
# pkg install yarn # will automatically install the corresponding version of nodejs
```

To install npm.

```
# pkg install npm
```

> If you skip the FreeBSD upgrade and install the software directly, then on FreeBSD 13.0 you will encounter the following error.
>
>```
># pkg install yarn
>% node
>ld-elf.so.1: /lib/libcrypto.so.111: version OPENSSL_1_1_1e required by /usr/local/bin/node not found
>```
