## Installation

>There are currently several versions of wildfly10, wildfly11, wildfly12, wildfly13, wildfly14, wildfly15, wildfly16, wildfly17, wildfly18, wildfly24, wildfly25, wildfly26, etc.

Here is an example of wildfly26.

```

## configure


Add the following code to `/etc/hosts`, where `server02` is the local `hostname` (the host name, set during installation).

```
127.0.0.1 server02
```

Some other settings are needed.

```
# sysrc wildfly26_enable="yes"
# sysrc wildfly26_args="-Djboss.bind.address=0.0.0.0 -Djboss.bind.address.management=0.0.0.0"
# sysrc wildfly26_log_stdout="/dev/null"
# sysrc wildfly26_log_stderr="/dev/null"
```

Then start the service.

```
# service wildfly26 start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to check the service status.


>**Optional**
>
>You can also use `/usr/local/wildfly26/bin/add-user.sh ` to generate an administrator account.


# Troubleshooting

If the service does not start properly, you can view the error log with `/usr/local/wildfly26/standalone/log/server.log`.
