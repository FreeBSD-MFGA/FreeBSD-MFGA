FreeBSD has four types of sources: pkg, ports, portsnap, and update.

**For versions that have lost security support, please refer to the last section**

**This article lists multiple mirror sites for a source, no need to configure all of them, just choose one of them. Recommend to use Beijing Jiaotong University Free and Open Source Software Mirror Station, because it is mirrored by reverse proxy and can keep synchronized with upstream.**

**There is no official mirror site in the territory, the following are unofficial mirror sites.**

## pkg source: pkg source provides binary installation package

The download path for pkg is `/var/cache/pkg/`.

The pkg source in FreeBSD is divided into two configuration files, system-level and user-level. It is not recommended to modify `/etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf` directly, as this file will change as the base system is updated.

Create a user-level source directory:

```
# mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
```

### Beijing Jiaotong University Free and Open Source Software Mirror Site

Create user-level source files:

```
# ee /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/bjtu.conf
```

Write the following:

```
bjtu: {  
url: "pkg+http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/reverse/freebsd-pkg/${ABI}/quarterly",  
mirror_type: "srv",  
signature_type: "none",  
fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",  
enabled: yes
}
FreeBSD: { enabled: no }
```

**Troubleshooting**

**To get rolling updates of packages, change ``quarterly`'' to ``latest`'. Note that the `CURRENT` version is only available as `latest`.**

**To use https, install `security/ca_root_nss` and change `http` to `https`, then use the command `# pkg update -f` to refresh the cache, as below.**

### NetEase open source mirror site

Create user-level source files:

```
# ee /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/163.conf
```

Write the following:

```
163: {  
url: "pkg+http://mirrors.163.com/freebsd-pkg/${ABI}/quarterly",  
mirror_type: "srv",  
signature_type: "none",  
fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",  
enabled: yes
}
FreeBSD: { enabled: no }
```

### University of Science and Technology of China open source software mirror site

Create user-level source files:

```
# ee /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/ustc.conf
```

Write the following:

```
ustc: {  
url: "pkg+http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/freebsd-pkg/${ABI}/quarterly",  
mirror_type: "srv",  
signature_type: "none",  
fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",  
enabled: yes
}
FreeBSD: { enabled: no }
```

### Nanjing University open source mirror site

```
# ee /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/nju.conf
```

Write the following:

```
nju: {  
url: "pkg+http://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/freebsd-pkg/${ABI}/quarterly",  
mirror_type: "srv",  
signature_type: "none",  
fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",  
enabled: yes
}
FreeBSD: { enabled: no }
```

## FreeBSD.cn (unofficial, same below)

```
# ee /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/freebsdcn.conf
```

Write the following:

```
freebsdcn: {  
url: "pkg+http://pkg.freebsd.cn/${ABI}/quarterly",  
mirror_type: "srv",  
signature_type: "none",  
fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",  
enabled: yes
}
FreeBSD: { enabled: no }
```

## ports source: package manager that provides a source way to install software

ports download path is `/usr/ports/distfiles`

## Beijing Jiaotong University Free and Open Source Software mirror site

Create or modify the file `# ee /etc/make.conf`:

Write the following:

`MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE?=http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/reverse/freebsd-pkg/ports-distfiles/`

### ee open source mirror site

Create or modify the file `# ee /etc/make.conf`:

Write the following:

`MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE?=http://mirrors.163.com/freebsd-ports/distfiles/`

### University of Science and Technology of China open source software mirror site

Create or modify the file `# ee /etc/make.conf`:

Write the following:

`MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE?=http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/freebsd-ports/distfiles/`

### FreeBSD.

Create or modify the file `# ee /etc/make.conf`:

Write the following:

``MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE?=http://ports.freebsd.cn/ports-distfiles/``

## portsnap source:packaged ports file

### Beijing Jiaotong University Free and Open Source Software mirror site

Edit portsnap configuration file `# ee /etc/portsnap.conf` :

Change `SERVERNAME=portsnap.FreeBSD.org` to `SERVERNAME=freebsd-portsnap.mirror.bjtulug.org`

**Get portsnap updates**

```
# portsnap fetch extract
```

**Troubleshooting**

```
Snapshot appears to have been created more than one day into the future!
(Is the system clock correct?)
Cowardly refusing to proceed any further.
```

Need to synchronize time.

```
ntpdate ntp.api.bz
```

### FreeBSD.

Edit the portsnap configuration file ``# ee /etc/portsnap.conf`` :

Change `SERVERNAME=portsnap.FreeBSD.org` to `SERVERNAME=portsnap.FreeBSD.cn`

## freebsd-update source: provide basic system updates

Note: This source is only available for release versions of first-level architectures. This means that current and stable are not available.
For a description of the architecture support levels see.

https://www.freebsd.org/platforms

### Beijing Jiaotong University Free and Open Source Software Mirror Site

Edit the `# ee /etc/freebsd-update.conf` file:

Change `ServerName update.FreeBSD.org` to `ServerName freebsd-update.mirror.bjtulug.org`

**Example: upgrading from FreeBSD 12 to 13.0**

`# freebsd-update -r 13.0-RELEASE upgrade`

### FreeBSD. 

Edit the `# ee /etc/freebsd-update.conf` file:

Change `ServerName update.FreeBSD.org` to `ServerName update.FreeBSD.cn`.

## Versions not supported by security (use as appropriate)

It is possible to use binary sources for non-security supported versions.

> Here, for example, is `FreeBSD 9.2`.

First switch to a working binary source

```
# setenv PACKAGESITE http://ftp-archive.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD-Archive/ports/amd64/packages-9.2-release/Latest
```

If the shell is not csh, then:

```
# export PACKAGESITE=http://ftp-archive.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD-Archive/ports/amd64/packages-9.2-release/Latest
```

Installation example: Now install `bsdinfo`.
```
root@ykla:~ # pkg_add -r bsdinfo                                                    
Fetching http://ftp-archive.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD-Archive/ports/amd64/packages-9.2-release/Latest/bsdinfo.tbz... Done.
```

**pkg is not available, it will tell you that `digests.txz` and `repo.txz` are not found, because pkgng is not officially supported at that time, only `pkg_*` command is still supported.**
