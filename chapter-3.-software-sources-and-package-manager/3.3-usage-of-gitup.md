# 3.3 Usage of gitup

> In FreeBSD 13.0, FreeBSD officials are planning to remove `portsnap` (but still use it) in favor of `gitup`, a replacement for the git method of getting the system source code and the ports package suite. However, it is unclear if this replacement will work.

```
# pkg install gitup # install gitup
# gitup ports #Get ports
# gitup release #Get the release version of the source code
```

## Troubleshooting: too slow

Setting up an HTTP proxy

The proxy for `gitup` does not depend on the system proxy, but is determined separately by its configuration file.

`# ee /usr/local/etc/gitup.conf`

Example (delete the preceding # before changing it)

```
"proxy_host" : "192.168.27.1",
"proxy_port" : 7890,
```
