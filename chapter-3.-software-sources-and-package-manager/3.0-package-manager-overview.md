# 3.0 Overview of the Package Manager

## FreeBSD Package Manager Design Philosophy

Those familiar with Linux may find that FreeBSD's package management scheme actually amounts to roughly a perfect amalgamation of the package managers of the following two major Linux distributions.

Arch Linux: Pacman, which corresponds to pkg (again with the KISS philosophy)

Gentoo Linux: Portage, which corresponds to Ports (Portage itself is a Ports knockoff)

>If you need to look up the specifics of a package in FreeBSD, you can do so: Google or Bing (many times not available) and search for "fteebsd ports package name". If that doesn't work, you can search for the package name directly on the website <https://www.freshports.org/>.
