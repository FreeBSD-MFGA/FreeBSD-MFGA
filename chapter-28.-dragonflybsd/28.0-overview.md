# 28.0 Overview

DragonFly BSD is a Unix-like operating system that was born from FreeBSD 4.8. The project was started by Matthew Dillon, who is based on the Amiga, and was launched in June 2003 and posted to the FreeBSD mailing list in July 2003.

Dillon started the DragonFly BSD project because he felt that the FreeBSD 5 developers had chosen a way to develop parallel computing, such as multiprocessors, that would degrade system performance. dillon tried to influence the design principles of the FreeBSD project and had a dispute with the FreeBSD developers, and his right to edit the source code directly was denied. Despite this, DragonFly BSD and the FreeBSD project are still working together to fix some bugs and update drivers.

The DrogonFly BSD has been hampered by continuing the path begun with FreeBSD 4. DragonFly development differs significantly from the FreeBSD base in several ways, including a lightweight kernel threading implementation and a rich HAMMER file system. Many of the concepts intended to be used to implement the DragonFly BSD borrow from solutions in the AmigaOS operating system.

> The DragonFly BSD documentation is old and does not match its development progress, but DragonFly BSD development is actually quite active. Don't be dissuaded by DragonFly BSD's outdated official documentation.
