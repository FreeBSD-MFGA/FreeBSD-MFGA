# 13.2 Enabling DTrace

## FreeBSD 11 onwards

`# kldload dtraceall`

can be turned on immediately

## For FreeBSD 9/10

The FreeBSD kernel does not have DTrace turned on by default. To enable this feature you must add parameters to recompile the kernel.

It is recommended that you read Chapter 20, Kernel.

Edit the kernel configuration file to add:



```
options KDTRACE_HOOKS
options DDB_CTF
makeoptions DEBUG=-g
makeoptions WITH_CTF=1
```

In case of 64-bit OS:

```
options KDTRACE_FRAME
```
