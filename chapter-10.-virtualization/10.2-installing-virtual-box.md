# 10.2 Installing Virtual Box

A pkg installation of Virtual Box will have several problems, such as not being able to load the `vboxdrv` module. If the installation does not start, try restarting your computer or running Virtual Box from the command line.

It is therefore recommended to use ports for installation:

```
# cd /usr/ports/emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions
# make BATCH=yes install clean
```
