# 20.5 Scientific and Professional Tools

## Tools and Software

Scientific computing software GNU Octave: `# pkg install octave`

Computer algebra system wxMaxima: `# pkg install wxmaxima`

Python and its related modules: `# pkg install python py38-scipy py38-pandas py38-matplotlib py38-sympy`

## Integration

In the previous section we used GLPK to solve the linear programming problem, in this section we use the more powerful wxMaxima to solve the problem. The following code is for reference only, for a deeper understanding, check out the [official documentation](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/docs/manual/index.html).

```maxima
load("simplex")$
maximize_lp(0.026 * x1 + 0.0509 * x2 + 0.0864 * x3 + 0.06875 * x4 + 0.78 * x5,
[x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 <= 1200,
x4 + x5 <= 0.4 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5),
x3 >= 0.5 * (x1 + x2 + x3),
0.1 * x1 + 0.07 * x2 + 0.03 * x3 + 0.05 * x4 + 0.02 * x5 <= 0.04 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)]),
epsilon_lp = 0, nonnegative_lp = true; 
```
The software gives the answer as `[436.608,[x5=480.0,x4=0,x3=720.0,x2=0,x1=0]`, which can be seen to be the same as the one obtained by GLPK. Problem solved.
