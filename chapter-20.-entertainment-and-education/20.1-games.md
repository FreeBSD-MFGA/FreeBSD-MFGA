### Classic open source games

## Wine / PlayOnBSD games

## Renpy game


`Renpy` is a visual novel engine that can be easily used to create interactive video games. Since the backbone of the game is the `Python` language, it can be easily ported to different system platforms, such as Windows and Linux.

Although `Renpy` is not system-adapted to `FreeBSD` at the moment, `FreeBSD` itself has packaged it twice. Does this make it possible to play interactive games on FreeBSD? Obviously not! However, we can try a little.


### How to do it

1. install renpy 

    `# pkg install renpy`
    
2. download the game

    Here is [Heartbeat Literature Club!] (https://teamsalvato.itch.io/ddlc) as an example, you can do the same for other games. Select the game with the Linux version to unzip. 3.
    
3. Run renpy
    
    You can see the game `DDLC-1.1.1` listed in the `Projects` on the left side of the engine interface, click the game and select `Launch Project` in the bottom right corner to load the game.

### Add

- Game distribution site: [itch](https://itch.io/)

- Try to choose a game with a Linux version

    If the game only supports Windows, you can package the Linux version with the renpy engine.
    
- Unpacking rpa files: [unrpa](https://github.com/Lattyware/unrpa)

    `python3 unrpa -mp "unpacking directory" "XXX.rpa"`
    
- rpyc file unpacking: [unrpyc](https://github.com/CensoredUsername/unrpyc)

    `python3 unrpyc -c "XXX.rpyc"` 
    
    This step is non-essential and is only for easy translation into other languages.
