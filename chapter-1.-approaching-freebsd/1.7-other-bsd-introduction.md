# 1.7 Introduction to other BSDs

OpenBSD focuses on security and is claimed to be the most secure operating system in the world (the German 2014 movie _Who Am I: No System Is Safe_ comes to mind); WiFi development is very aggressive and already supports intel AX200; however, packages are small and old, e.g. KDE is only 3.5; sudo and linux compatibility layers have been dropped for security and support for Nvidia card support is also problematic; it is generally used as a firewall development.

FreeBSD has the most developers, the most users, and the most packages, with ZFS and Linux-compatible layers.

NetBSD has a lot of architectural support, but generally poor support because there are not enough developers to maintain several architectures at the same time by one developer.

DragonFlyBSD (Dragonfly BSD) comes with an i915 graphics driver, but the documentation is lagging and the architecture is not well supported.
