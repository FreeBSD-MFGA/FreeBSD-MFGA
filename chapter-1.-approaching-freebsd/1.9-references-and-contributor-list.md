It is still recommended to use the third edition, which is more relevant to FreeBSD. However, some of the arguments to commands such as grep will be different and are worth noting. There are some sections that are not necessary for FreeBSD and can be skipped: 0, 2, 3, 4, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26.
