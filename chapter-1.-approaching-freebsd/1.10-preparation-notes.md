# 1.10 Compilation Notes

## pkg vs. ports

  Since there are two ways to install software in FreeBSD (but not all software supports the pkg installation method), for convenience, installation instructions for both methods may not appear in this run-through tutorial. However, it is important to understand that this is for convenience only, not that you cannot install using either ports or pkg or that you must install using one of the two.
  
 > **Please note that ports is generally a HEAD branch, and it is best to keep your pkg on the same mainline as ports, i.e. both select `latest`.**

## The meaning of the symbols before the commands in this book

`#` means operation under `root`, same as `sudo`.

`$` for general user privileges

## Requirements for users

The difficulty benchmark is based on the level of pass or above that can be achieved by an average undergraduate of computer science and technology in higher education institutions. If you fail to meet the requirements, please study on your own.

## Positioning of this book

Our goal is not to translate the Handbook, but rather to write a FreeBSD-based tutorial similar to Bird's Linux Private Practice: Basic Learning + Bird's Linux Private Practice: Server Setup in one. In other words, we are a superset of the Handbook.
