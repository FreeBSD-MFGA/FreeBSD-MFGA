# 8.1 sudo

## Installation

>OpenBSD has developed [doas](https://man.openbsd.org/doas), FreeBSD) (which is also available for FreeBSD) because it considered the software to be too buggy, and FreeBSD because its license is incompatible with the BSD license and is therefore not preconfigured.


The FreeBSD base system does not come with the `sudo` command by default; you need to install it yourself using the `root` privilege:

```
# pkg install sudo
```

## sudo password free


Under `/usr/local/etc/sudoers.d/` create two new files `username` (the user who needs to be password free) and `wheel`.

  - The contents of the file `username` are as follows.

```
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

  - File `wheel` reads as follows

Add an extra line `NOPASSWD:` to use `sudo` without entering the password:

```
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
