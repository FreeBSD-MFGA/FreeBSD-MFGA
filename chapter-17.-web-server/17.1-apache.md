## 17.1 Apache

## Installing


```
# cd /usr/ports/www/apache24/ && make install clean
```

or

```
# pkg install apache24
```

## Start the service

```
# add service bootable
# sysrc apache24_enable=YES

# Start the service
# service apache24 start

# Check the status
# service apache24 status
```

By definition, the apache service has been started, so now you can open the URL ``localhost`` and take a look.
