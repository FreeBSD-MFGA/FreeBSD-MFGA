# 17.7 SSL Configuration

> Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are security protocols designed to provide security and data integrity guarantees for Internet communications. The IETF standardized on SSL and published the TLS 1.0 standard document (RFC 2246) in 1999. This was followed by the publication of TLS 1.1 (RFC 4346, 2006), TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246, 2008) and TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446, 2018). This protocol is widely used in applications such as browsers, email, instant messaging, VoIP, and Internet fax. It has now become the industry standard for confidential communications over the Internet.
