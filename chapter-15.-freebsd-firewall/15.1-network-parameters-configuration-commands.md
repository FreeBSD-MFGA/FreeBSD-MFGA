# 15.1 network parameter configuration commands



#### System Setup Utility bsdconfig

`# bsdconfig` is a system configuration utility provided by FreeBSD as a shell interface.

#### secure manipulation of rc files

`# sysrc` is a FreeBSD-supplied rc file utility that replaces manual editing of `rc.conf`.

#### as a gateway server

Turn on IP forwarding for.

```
# sysrc gateway_enable="YES"
# sysrc ipv6_gateway_enable="YES"
```

Open the firewall and enable NAT.

```
# sysrc firewall_enable="YES"
# sysrc firewall_script="/etc/ipfw.rules"
# sysrc firewall_nat_enable="YES"
```

Set default connection acceptance: `# ee /boot/loader.conf`

```
net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
```

#### Manually set resolv.conf

After manually editing resolv.conf, rebooting the system will reset it again because DHCP will rewrite this file.

To prevent the `resolvconf` service from overwriting resolv.conf: ``# ee /etc/resolvconf.conf`

```
resolv_conf="/dev/null"
```

Edit resolv.conf again and you're done.

#### View NIC rate

Refresh every 1 second.

```
# systat -if 1
```
