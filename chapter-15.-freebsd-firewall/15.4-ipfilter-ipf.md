# 15.4 IPFILTER (IPF)

IPF is an open source software by Darren Reed.

If you want to enable ipf, you can execute the following command. 

```
# ipfilter 

# cp /usr/share/examples/ipfilter/ipf.conf.sample /etc/ipf.rules # Copy the example file as the default configuration ruleset file, otherwise ipfilter will start without rules. The rules that come with the sample file do not affect use 

# service ipfilter enable # Set ipfilter to boot, or set ipfilter_enable via bsdconfig 

# service ipfilter start # Start ipfilter #ipnat sudo cp /usr/share/examples/ipfilter/ipnat.conf.sample /etc/ipnat.rules # Copy the example file as the default configuration ruleset file, otherwise ipnat will not start 

# service ipnat enable # Set ipnat to boot, or you can set ipnat_enable via bsdconfig 

# service ipnat start # Start ipnat.
```

Note that after the ipfilter service is restarted, ipnat needs to be restarted as well.

The main management commands for ipf are ipf, ipfstat, and ipnat, and examples of common operations are as follows. 

```
# ipf -E #Start ipfilter, equivalent to service ipfilter start 

# ipf -D #Stop ipfilter, equivalent to server ipfilter stop 

# ipf -f /etc/ipf.rules # Load rules from the ruleset file ipfstat # View all rules 

# ipfstat -iohn #View rules, i for input rules, o for output rules, h for traffic passing through the rule, n for record number

# ipfstat -t #Enter monitoring mode, press Q to exit 

# ipf -Fa #Clean up loaded rules 

# ipnat -f /etc/ipnat.rules #Load nat rules from the ruleset file 

# ipnat -s #Summarize and display nat status ipnat -lh #List nat rules, add h to show also traffic passing through the rule 

# ipnat -CF #Clean loaded nat rules However, the above operation does not manage the rules, so you also need to modify the ruleset file, commonly used examples are as follows: block all # # Deny all access. ipfilter is a firewall that explicitly forbids by default, so you need to block all access by the following rules block in all #block is the action block means deny, pass means pass; in is the data direction, in is in, out is out, data direction is required in ipfilter; all is shorthand for from any to any, which means from the source address to the destination address, the address is usually a network segment (such as 192.168.1.0/24) or IP address (such as 192.168. 1.100), any is a special word that means any address 

block out all # Release access to the loopback interface, the loopback interface is not external 

pass in quick on lo0 all #quick keyword indicates that if the rule matches, it will stop execution and will not execute subsequent rules 

pass out quick on lo0 all #Add rules for TCP protocol access to port 80 

pass in quick proto tcp from any to 192.168.1.184 port = 80 #Allows any device to access port 80 on the local machine by TCP protocol. where proto tcp is the access protocol, commonly used values are tcp, udp, tcp/udp, icmp, not written means that all protocols are supported; port = 80 is the port, written after the target address for the target port, the source address is not written, that is, from the source address of any port to initiate access 

pass out quick proto tcp from 192.168.1.184 to any # allow the display of information back to any access device # add port 80 to 8080 port traffic forwarding rules 

pass in quick proto tcp from any to 192.168.1.184 port = 80 # first release ipfilter access restrictions rdr em0 192.168.1.184 port 80 -> 192.168.1.184 port 8080 # since the test machine has only one network card, so forwarding is limited to this machine 

pass out quick proto icmp from 192.168.1.184 to any icmp-type 8 keep state # Allow this machine to ping any external device. Where ICMP type 8 is a query request; keep state means maintain state. If combined with the following example, the pinging function will be completely released 

pass in quick proto icmp from any to 192.168.1.184 icmp-type 8 keep state # Allow any external device to ping this machine 

pass out quick proto icmp from 192.168.1.184 to any icmp-type 0 #allow traceroute commands to be executed with ICMP protocol 

pass out quick proto udp from 192.168.1.184 to any port 33434 << 34500 keep state #traceroute default protocol UDP, port number from 33434, add 1 for each forwarding port number 
```

The following ruleset file, `/etc/ipf.rules`, is based on my operating system.

```
block in all

block out all 

pass in quick on lo0 all 

pass out quick on lo0 all # Set any device to access ports 22, 80, 443, 4200, 10000 of the server 

pass in quick proto tcp from any to 192.168.1.184 port = { 22,80,443,4200,10000 } 

pass out quick proto tcp from 192.168.1.184 port = { 22,80,443,4200,10000 } to any pass out quick proto tcp from 192.168.1.184 to any port = { 80,443 } keep state # Set the server to access port 80, 443 of any network device 

pass out quick proto udp from any to any port = 53 keep state # Set up access to DNS servers 

pass out quick proto udp from any to any port = 67 keep state #Set up access to DHCP servers 

pass out quick proto icmp from 192.168.1.184 to any icmp-type 8 keep state

pass in quick proto icmp from any to 192.168.1.184 icmp-type 8 keep state 

pass out quick proto icmp from 192.168.1.184 to any icmp-type 0 

pass out quick proto udp from 192.168.1.184 to any port 33434 << 34500 keep state

pass in quick proto tcp from any to 192.168.1.184 port = 8080 # Release the corresponding port before data forwarding 
```

Then organize the NAT ruleset file `/etc/ipnat.rules` as follows. 

```
# rdr em0 192.168.1.184 port 8080 -> 192.168.1.184 port 80 # Set the local 8080 to port 80 mapping 
```

Save the file and next execute the command in the terminal. 

```
# ipf -Fa -f /etc/ipf.rules # Load the rules from the ruleset file

# ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules # Load the nat rules from the ruleset file and you will see the results.
```
