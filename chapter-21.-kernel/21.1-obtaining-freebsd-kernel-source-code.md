# 21.1 Obtaining FreeBSD Kernel Source Code

The FreeBSD project was fully migrated from SVN to Git in 2021, namely

<https://git.freebsd.org>

So the way to get the source code has changed.

## Getting the source code from Git

```
# pkg install -y gitup 
# gitup release # You need to refer to the current gitup configuration https://github.com/johnmehr/gitup/blob/main/gitup.conf
# gitup current # Get the current source code
```

# # Get the source code from the tarball (recommended)

This method is quick and easy.

Using FreeBSD 13.1 as an example.

```
# fetch https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/13.1-RELEASE/src.txz
# tar xvzfp src.txz -C /
```
> If you are slow you can switch to <https://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn/freebsd/releases/amd64/13.1-RELEASE/src.txz>
