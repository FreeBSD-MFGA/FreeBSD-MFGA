## Overview

### Motto

Adhere to the ancient laws in pursuit of true freedom.

### Positioning of the book

Our goal is not to translate the Handbook, but rather to write a FreeBSD-based tutorial similar to *Linux Private Kitchens: basic learning articles* + *Linux Private Kitchens: Server Setup* in one. That is, this book is a superset of the Handbook.

### Summary of the Editor's Guide

All supporters of FreeBSD are welcome to write and will be added to the list of contributors.

## Preface

### FreeBSD MFGA

This book was created on December 19, 2021. It was written with the goal of Making FreeBSD Great Again, and is written to cover the basics and advanced knowledge of FreeBSD. If you have some UNIX knowledge, you can skip the first chapter, but if you have some knowledge of FreeBSD, you are welcome to join us and contribute to this book.

### Executive Summary

This book was started by ykla and written with the participation of some group members of the  FreeBSD MFGA, "FreeBSD from Getting Started to Running". We have attempted to start from zero and lead the average person into the world of FreeBSD, fully referencing the FreeBSD Handbook and building a complete, scientific catalog system. This book is not a hodgepodge of tutorials or a collection of tutorials, but rather an open source book designed to build a self-contained system. The book is divided into thirty chapters, emphasizing the fundamentals necessary for learning FreeBSD as well as providing specialized tutorials on kernel design and implementation. This book can be used as a textbook for undergraduate students in the "FreeBSD Operating System" course in higher education, as well as for graduate students or computer technicians in related fields.

### Feedback

Due to the limitations of the author, it is inevitable that the book will contain flaws and errors, and we hope that you will feel free to offer criticism so that we can correct them. You can use Github's interactive features to contact us: submit an issue, pull request, or join a [Telegram group](https://t.me/FreeBSD_MFGA) to contact us directly (yklaxds AT gmail DOT com), etc.

### TODO / Wishlist

There is still a lot of work to be done, including but not limited to:

- The FreeBSD 14 shell has been standardized to `sh`, and tutorials need to be standardized for it
- Organizing and uploading configuration files and environments
- Optimize the formatting of the tutorial directory
- Improve the current blank chapters and test and verify existing content
- actively promote and seek official publication
- Remove external references to text/images and other content or give standardized citation statements to avoid copyright issues
- Consider elevating the Virtual Box virtual machine in this paper because of the many business changes resulting from Broadcom's acquisition of VMware
- Remove or add examples of ideas that are too subjective or unsupported

## About

### The vision of the FreeBSD MFGA

We were founded on March 17, 2018, and have grown a Telegram group, and as far as a WeChat group.

Our membership is very broad and universal, representing the average of the vast majority of FreeBSD users: they may not have even heard of what FreeBSD is, but that does not stop us from communicating and exchanging ideas. Some may feel that this is a waste of time, but without the nurturing of new talent, what would FreeBSD be tomorrow? Who doesn't know that newcomers may have many bad habits.

As Mr. Lu Xun said, may each person be a beam of light to illuminate the glorious thorny path of FreeBSD's advancement in mainland China. I also hope that you can join us to form a starry sky or a glowing fire.

The infinite distant lands, the countless people, are all related to me.

I have looked into the distant mountains countless times, trying to find a clear spring, but the sky is always not as it should be, still not found.

Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? These questions will never be answered.

We chose FreeBSD because we wanted a clear, unambiguous, reliable, and solid operating system that would bring us profit in our work and pleasure in our lives. Of course there are still many problems with FreeBSD that need to be actively discovered, explored, and improved. Society is progressing, technology is advancing, enthusiasm is continuing unabated, and the future is getting better and better.
