Our Android phones, most of the ARM chip, even if the song _Huawei Mei_ the so-called "Chinese core" is also derived from ARM's patent license, without the license, what core is not.

And Raspberry Pi is a development board using ARM chips, is a rich interface (HDMI, I2C, USB X 4, POE module, etc.) of the board, equivalent to a lower configuration of the phone, the phone can do things, Raspberry Pi can do. It is generally used for embedded development, such as robotics, routers and monitoring, etc.

FreeBSD's support for architecture is divided by level, ARM is a secondary architecture (FreeBSD 13 was upgraded to treat it as a primary architecture), so software support is not as good as AMD64, and some software cannot be compiled in source form through ports, for example, compiling X11/xorg will encounter many errors (a list of bugs has been reported).
