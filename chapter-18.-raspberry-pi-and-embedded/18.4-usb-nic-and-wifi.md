# 18.4 USB Network Cards and WIFI

The Raspberry Pi 4 is a relatively well configured model, so the onboard Bluetooth and WIFI are not available because the FreeBSD SDIO driver does not fully support them (you can purchase a wireless card, we recommend the COMFAST CF-WU810N).

If you have purchased the above wireless card and want to automatically connect to wifi on boot, it is very simple.

Method: `/boot/loader.conf` write

```
rtwn_usb_load="YES"
legal.realtek.license_ack=1
```

In /etc/rc.conf write

```
wlans_rtwn0="wlan0"
ifconfig_wlan0="WPA DHCP"
```

Note that in the /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file (if you don't have one, create one yourself with the `touch` command) write

```
network={ ssid="wifi name" psk="password" }
```

Just save and reboot. This will enable automatic wifi connection on boot.
